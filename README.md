# Project 1

For this project, we wanted to see the correlation between California Geography and Solar Installations. California is the national leader in solar panel installations, and understanding this correlation could help to inform the current state of the solar industry.

# Requirements to run code:

In order to run the code that we worked on, several dependencies must be installed:
1. Matplotlib
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn (download here: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.14-visualization-with-seaborn.html)
4. Gmaps (download here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)
    - In order to get the Google Maps API to run, you must:
        a. Register for an API Key
        b. Create a file called keys.py
        c. Create a variable called gkey, and input your Google Maps API key 
            (ex. gkey = "your API key")

# Where we found our data:

1. Number of Solar Installations: https://openpv.nrel.gov/search
2. Climate Zone Data: California Energy Commission. California Climate Zone Descriptions for New Buildings. July 1995.
3. Climate Zone Details: California Energy Commission. California Climate Zone Descriptions for New Buildings. July 1995.
4. Sunny Days: https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-sunshine-by-city.php
5. Population data: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF
6. Electricy Consumption by County: http://ecdms.energy.ca.gov/elecbycounty.aspx

# Jupyter notebook analysis

Look at "NAME HERE" to see the initial data cleaning.

Look at "NAME HERE" to see the visualizations.

Main idea: The geography of California will have an effect on the number of solar installations in the state.

1. Hypothesis: Climate zones with the higher temperature recorded will have more installations.

2. Hypothesis: Cities in the Central Valley of California will have more solar installations.

3. Hypothesis: Climate zones with more sunny days will have a higher percentage of solar installations per number of housing units.

4. Hypothesis: Climate zones with more sunny days will have smaller solar installations.

5. Hypothesis: Climate zones with more sunny days will have a lower cost per watt for solar installations.
